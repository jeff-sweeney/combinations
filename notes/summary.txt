SUMMARY:

This invention is an algorithm that lists combinations of
non-repeating elements in an order that is easy for humans to use. It
does this by making several improvements to a machine order
algorithm. First, it exploits the fact that when an integer is
repeatedly incremented or decremented the less significant bits change
more rapidly than the more significant bits. Second, the integer that
is incremented in the machine order algorithm is instead decremented
and the orders of the set of elements and the combinations formed from
them are reversed. Finally, subsets of the set of elements to combine
are listed in order from a subset containing zero elements to one
containing all the elements. For the previous illustration this
invention would list the combinations in this order:

 i  bits  combination

 0  0000   - - - -
 8  1000   A - - -
 4  0100   - B - -
 2  0010   - - C -
 1  0001   - - - D
12  1100   A B - -
10  1010   A - C -
 9  1001   A - - D
 6  0110   - B C -
 5  0101   - B - D
 3  0011   - - C D
14  1110   A B C -
13  1101   A B - D
11  1011   A - C D
 7  0111   - B C D
15  1111   A B C D
